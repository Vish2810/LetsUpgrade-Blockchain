Day 1 Assignment

Q.1 What is your understanding of Block-chain?

Ans: It is a concept derived by mix technology to ensures data is not changed or tampered and is verifiable at any given instance. It is a combination of cryptography and distributed database where data is segmented in blocks which are stored in multiple machines. It is one-way encryption & for every data it generates a unique hash.

Q.2 What is the core problem block-chain trying to solve?

Ans: Core Problem which can be solved using block-chain is security, authenticity & trust monopoly of data.

Q.3 What are the few features which block-chain will give u?

Ans : Transparency of data
Tamper Proof Data
Immutable / Unchanged data
Verifiable data
Highly secure


Q.4 What all things does a Block Contain?

Ans: A block within a chain of blocks consists of
1. block number;
2. Transaction records;
3. previous block signature;
4. mining key.

First block in chain is called Genesis block and its previous block signature is blank

Q.5 How is the Verifiability of Block-chain is been attained?

Ans: Verifiability is attained by comparing hash generated of data which always includes hash of previous data, at a given time hash should match. Since its one-way encryption, verification is done by comparing hash.
